----

## Setting up doctl

- Install doctl manually, or via choco. `choco install doctl`
- Authorize doctl. `doctl auth init --context customname`
- Switch to the new identity context. `doctl auth switch --context customname`
- Install the DigitalOcean sandbox: `doctl sls install`
- Connect to your sandbox: `doctl sandbox connect`

----

## Convert from Template to Function

- Modify `.do/deploy.template.yaml`
  - Edit `functions/github/repo` to your desired repo `user/repo`.
  - Edit `functions/name` to your desired function name.
  - Edit `name` to your desired do function name.

For more details see [App Specification Reference](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/references/app-specification-reference/) and [How To - Manage Functions](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/how-to/manage-functions/)

### Project.yml

- In order to have the unmodified body be passed to your function,
be sure to set the following in project.yml.

```yml
packages:
  - name: test-serverless
    actions:
      - name: test
        runtime: 'python:default'
        web: raw

```

----

## Testing - Deploy to DO Function

If you have dependencies in any of the actions,
you will need to implement `build.<sh|cmd>` scripts for your platform.

`doctl sls deploy . --incremental`

If you'd rather just implement different platform build scripts,
then use the following command to keep to one.

`doctl sls deploy . --remote-build`

### Environment Variables

If you have environment variables, add this flag to the deploy command.
`--env .env`

### Watch

You may also use incremental directory watching to avoid having to run deployment automatically.

`doctl sls watch .`

### Errors

> Error: While deploying action 'some-service/action': Action is named in the config but does not exist in the project

This means that you've forgotten to rename the folder structures that your function lives in. Ex. `packagtes/digitalocean-serverless/test`.

----

## Deploying to an App

- Before you deploy to an app you'll need to make the build scripts executable if you haven't already. Run `git update-index --chmod=+x path/to/build.ext` for each of the builds scripts.

----

## Renaming an App

### Renaming Steps

- Rename the function folder. `packages/myservice/function` -> `packages/newservice/newfuncname`
- Update `project.yml` name fields.
- Update `.do/deploy.template.yaml` name fields.

### Execution Status

- If you rename the app, the build scripts will lose their 755 property. Run [See Deploying to an App](#deploying-to-an-app)
